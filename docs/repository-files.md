# Repository files

## Purpose

This document lists the files and directories that belong to this repository
template.

## Scope

This inventory covers repository-level files and directories that are included,
deferred, or explicitly excluded from the template.

## Status definitions

- `required`: included in the base template.
- `optional`: included in the template, but safe to remove or adapt in
  downstream projects.
- `deferred`: intentionally postponed until a concrete need is confirmed.
- `rejected`: intentionally excluded from the template.
- `duplicate`: excluded because another path owns the same responsibility.
